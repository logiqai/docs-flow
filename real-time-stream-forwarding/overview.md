LOGIQ.AI simplifies real-time streaming services through the establishment of "forwarders" within our platform – these forwarders can be associated with a namespace and application or with any featured attribute in the message itself. All it takes is data that matches your criteria, then we'll instantly direct it toward the necessary streaming service! This helps to reduce the complexity of setting up data pipelines, while at the same time providing more flexibility and scalability. By leveraging our powerful query engine and advanced analytics capabilities, LOGIQ.AI provides an easy way to selectively filter out only the most important pieces of information so companies can be confident they are making informed decisions with current, accurate data.

# Overview

A Data warehouse provides a unified and comprehensive view of an organization's data, enabling users to perform complex queries, generate reports, and gain insights into their business operations. Data warehouses achieve this by integrating data from various sources, transforming it into a consistent format, and organizing it according to a dimensional data model. The primary goal of a data warehouse is to support business intelligence and decision-making activities.

Apica provides a forward plugin that will forward your logs to data warehouse. All you need to do is to create a forwarder and map that forwarder to your desired namespace and application.

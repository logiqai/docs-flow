# Overview

Security has become a major concern for all enterprises. The number of data breaches and security breaks happening currently forces all enterprises to detect and monitor the safety of their applications to prevent potential security threats.

Apica enables you to stay one step ahead of potential threats. With our forwarder plugins and other log manipulations, you can detect and mitigate security threats quickly.&#x20;

These forwarders can be associated with a namespace and application or with any featured attribute in the message itself. All it takes is data that matches your criteria, then we'll instantly direct it toward the configured security monitoring tool.
